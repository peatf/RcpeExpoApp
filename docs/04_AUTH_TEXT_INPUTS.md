# Text Input Box Functionality on Authentication Screens

## Overview
This document details the investigation and resolution of issues with text input boxes on the authentication screens, ensuring they function correctly and are styled according to the app's design.

## Goals
- Fix any issues with text input components on the login and sign-up screens.
- Ensure inputs are styled correctly, especially on focus.
- Guarantee that user input is properly captured and handled.

## File Locations
- `src/screens/Auth/LoginScreen.tsx`
- `src/screens/Auth/SignUpScreen.tsx`
- `src/constants/theme.ts` (for styling)

## Implementation Details
### 1. Investigate Issues
- Review the text input components in both `LoginScreen.tsx` and `SignUpScreen.tsx`.
- Check for issues in styling, state management, and event handlers (e.g., `onChangeText`, `value`).

### 2. Fix Styling and Functionality
- Update styles to ensure inputs are visually clear and indicate focus.
- Ensure state is managed correctly so that user input is captured and displayed.
- Test keyboard behavior and input validation.

### 3. Align with Theme
- Use color, font, and spacing values from `src/constants/theme.ts` for consistency.

### 4. Testing
- Test on both iOS and Android devices (if applicable) for consistent behavior.

## Dependencies
- No new dependencies required.

## Notes
- Coordinate with design guidelines in `src/constants/theme.ts`.
- Test with various input scenarios (e.g., empty, invalid, valid).
