# Impulse Integration (Manifestors)

## Purpose
Help Manifestors harness their natural initiating power by capturing, evaluating, and implementing creative impulses with proper timing and strategic communication while minimizing resistance and maximizing impact.

## User Stories & Usage Flows
- As a Manifestor, I want to capture spontaneous impulses before they fade or get suppressed
- As a Manifestor, I want to evaluate which impulses are most aligned with my authentic path
- As a Manifestor, I want to develop effective informing strategies to reduce resistance to my initiatives
- As a Manifestor, I want to track my energy cycles to time my actions for maximum impact
- As a Manifestor, I want to distinguish between conditioned responses and true initiating impulses

## Authority-Specific Logic

### Emotional Authority (Common for Manifestors)
- **Impulse Feature:**
  - Emotion-aware impulse capture
  - Impulse evaluation against emotional wave position
  - Strategic waiting period integration
  - Impact projection based on emotional clarity

- **Background Logic:**
  - Track impulse emergence against emotional wave
  - Calculate ideal waiting periods for different impulse types
  - Identify emotional states producing most sustainable impulses
  - Map resistance patterns to emotional state during informing

- **Integration Intelligence:**
  - "This impulse emerged during emotional high - flag for reevaluation during clarity"
  - "Based on your pattern, waiting 36-48 hours will provide emotional clarity on this initiative"
  - "Impulses that persist across full emotional wave show highest sustainability"
  - "Historical data shows informing during emotional neutral state reduces resistance by 40%"

### Ego Authority (Common for Manifestors)
- **Impulse Feature:**
  - Desire vs willpower impulse classification
  - Commitment sustainability projection
  - Heart-centered authenticity check
  - Strategic willpower allocation advisor

- **Background Logic:**
  - Distinguish between heart-centered vs ego-driven impulses
  - Calculate commitment sustainability based on desire authenticity
  - Identify willpower cycles and optimal initiation timing
  - Map resistance patterns related to desire vs control dynamics

- **Integration Intelligence:**
  - "This impulse aligns with your core desires rather than external expectations"
  - "Similar initiatives show higher sustainability when based in true desire vs willpower"
  - "Your willpower is currently in renewal phase - consider delaying high-effort informing"
  - "Projects initiated from authentic desire show 70% less resistance from others"

### Splenic Authority (Common for Manifestors)
- **Impulse Feature:**
  - In-the-moment impulse validation
  - Safety and alignment intuition check
  - Spontaneous timing optimization
  - Clarity on what/when to inform based on intuitive hits

- **Background Logic:**
  - Track spontaneous impulse-to-action timing effectiveness
  - Identify physical sensation patterns related to aligned impulses
  - Calculate optimal informing approach based on intuitive signals
  - Map health impacts of following vs ignoring splenic impulses

- **Integration Intelligence:**
  - "This impulse triggered strong splenic signal - consider immediate, focused action"
  - "Your body is signaling caution - potential resistance factor identified"
  - "Splenic impulses implemented within 24 hours show 60% higher completion rate"
  - "Historical pattern shows throat constriction when informing approach needs adjustment"

## Natural Usage Examples

### Emotional Manifestor
- Impulse capture: "Create a community art space downtown" + Emotional state: "High, excited" → System flags: "Consider reevaluating during emotional clarity in approximately 2-3 days"
- Evaluation: After emotional cycle → "This impulse maintained consistent energy through emotional wave - sustainability prediction: High"
- Informing strategy: "For city officials, prepare informing message during emotional neutral phase, emphasize community benefits first, then share your vision"
- Energy forecast: "Based on your pattern, optimal implementation window begins Friday after adequate rest Thursday evening"

### Ego Manifestor
- Impulse capture: "Change career to wildlife photography" + Desire check: "Strong authentic desire, not external expectation" → Evaluation: "Aligned with true heart desire, sustainability prediction: High"
- Willpower gauge: "Current reserves at 40% - consider strategic informing now but delay implementation start by 3-5 days"
- Informing template: "For family stakeholders: Start with heart-centered 'why', acknowledge impact on others, then share logistical details"
- Implementation guide: "Break initiative into desire-aligned phases to maintain heart connection throughout process"

### Splenic Manifestor
- Impulse capture: "Immediately end business partnership" + Splenic signal: "Strong throat tightening, gut clarity" → System response: "Splenic clarity detected, consider prompt action within 24 hours"
- Safety check: "Previous similar impulses proved accurate and prevented larger issues"
- Informing guidance: "Direct, clear communication recommended within 12 hours. Template provided with safety-focused explanation"
- Health alignment: "Acting on this impulse aligns with previous health improvement patterns after following splenic clarity"
