# Pattern Recognition Engine

## Purpose
Automatically identify and reveal personal behavioral and decision-making patterns across time without overwhelming analysis, helping users recognize their natural rhythms, tendencies, and decision strategies aligned with their Human Design authority.

## User Stories & Usage Flows
- As a user, I want to discover meaningful patterns in my decisions and behaviors without manual analysis
- As a user, I want insights about my decision-making patterns based on my Human Design authority type
- As a user, I want to see correlations between my actions, decisions, and outcomes over time
- As a user, I want authority-specific pattern recognition that enhances my self-awareness
- As a user, I want to understand behavioral patterns that support or hinder my authentic decision-making

## Authority-Specific Logic

### Emotional Authority
- **Pattern Recognition Focus:**
  - Emotional wave cycles and their impact on decision quality
  - Correlation between emotional state at decision time and later satisfaction
  - Identification of personal "clarity markers" post-emotional wave
  - Decision regret frequency analysis related to wave position
  
- **Background Logic:**
  - Track decisions against emotional wave position
  - Calculate average time from emotional peak to clarity
  - Identify decision types most vulnerable to wave distortion
  - Map satisfaction ratings against wave position at decision time

- **Pattern Insights:**
  - "You make most regretted decisions at emotional peaks"
  - "Your clarity typically emerges 2-3 days after emotional storms"
  - "Decisions about X made during emotional neutral periods show 80% higher satisfaction"
  - "You tend to commit during emotional highs but later feel uncertain"

### Sacral Authority
- **Pattern Recognition Focus:**
  - Correlation between gut response and outcome satisfaction
  - Energy depletion patterns when ignoring sacral responses
  - Context patterns where gut response is most reliable
  - Time-of-day patterns for strongest sacral clarity
  
- **Background Logic:**
  - Track decisions with and against gut response
  - Identify energy level patterns related to response alignment
  - Map contexts/environments where gut response is most accurate
  - Analyze response consistency across different decision domains

- **Pattern Insights:**
  - "Following your gut response on career decisions resulted in 90% satisfaction"
  - "You consistently ignore gut responses in social settings, leading to energy depletion"
  - "Morning gut responses (6-10am) show highest correlation with later satisfaction"
  - "You experience most energy when gut responses align with actions in creative domains"

### Splenic Authority
- **Pattern Recognition Focus:**
  - Correlation between spontaneous intuition and later validation
  - Physical sensation patterns during accurate intuitive hits
  - Environmental factors affecting intuition clarity
  - Time lag between intuition and conscious recognition
  
- **Background Logic:**
  - Track intuitive impulses against later outcomes
  - Identify physical sensations that correlate with accurate intuition
  - Map environmental triggers that enhance splenic clarity
  - Analyze response time between intuition and action

- **Pattern Insights:**
  - "Intuitive hits accompanied by throat constriction were 85% accurate"
  - "Your intuition is most reliable in quiet environments with few people"
  - "You consistently dismiss initial intuitive flashes but later recognize their accuracy"
  - "Health-related intuitions show highest accuracy when accompanied by chest sensations"

### Ego Authority
- **Pattern Recognition Focus:**
  - Alignment between stated desires and commitment follow-through
  - Willpower cycles and their impact on commitment sustainability
  - Correlation between true desire and outcome satisfaction
  - Patterns of projection vs. authentic wanting
  
- **Background Logic:**
  - Track desire-statement consistency over time
  - Identify willpower depletion cycles
  - Map heart-centered decisions vs. mental/external influence decisions
  - Analyze commitment sustainability against desire authenticity

- **Pattern Insights:**
  - "Commitments aligned with stated desires show 3x higher completion rate"
  - "Your willpower cycles peak mid-week and decline sharply Friday-Sunday"
  - "Decisions made for others' benefit show 40% higher abandonment rate"
  - "Your sustainable commitments consistently align with true desires, not social expectations"

### Self-Projected Authority
- **Pattern Recognition Focus:**
  - Clarity patterns before and after verbal processing
  - Speaking partner influence on decision clarity
  - Environment impact on verbal processing effectiveness
  - Time patterns between speaking and clarity emergence
  
- **Background Logic:**
  - Track clarity shifts through verbal processing stages
  - Identify optimal speaking partners for different decision types
  - Map environmental factors affecting verbal clarity
  - Analyze time needed between speaking and decision clarity

- **Pattern Insights:**
  - "Verbal processing with [specific person] consistently yields highest clarity"
  - "You reach clearest decisions after processing verbally in outdoor settings"
  - "Major decisions benefit from 3+ verbal processing sessions across 48 hours"
  - "Speaking about options in sequence rather than parallel increases your clarity"

### Mental Authority
- **Pattern Recognition Focus:**
  - Environmental influence on decision clarity
  - Discussion partner diversity impact on perspective
  - Decision satisfaction correlation with information diversity
  - Time patterns for optimal information processing
  
- **Background Logic:**
  - Track decision quality against environmental factors
