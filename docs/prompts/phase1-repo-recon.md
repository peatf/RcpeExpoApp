# Phase 1: Repository Reconnaissance & Fragmentation Analysis (Revised)

**Objective:** To ensure you, the AI developer, have a complete and accurate understanding of the codebase's current state before writing any code. This phase is for analysis only.

**To Jules:**

Your task is to perform a read-only review of the codebase to verify the audit's findings. **You must not write or modify any code during this phase.** This is a critical step to prevent rework.

**Mandatory Review Checklist:**

1.  **Confirm Core Architecture:**
    *   **File:** `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`
    *   **Action:** Read this file.
    *   **Verify:** Confirm that the navigator switches between `<AuthNavigator/>` and `<MainTabNavigator/>` based *only* on the `user` object. Note the absence of any "profile readiness" check. This is the "missing gate" and is the central problem you will solve.

2.  **Trace Data Fragmentation:**
    *   **File:** `src/screens/Main/ProfileCreationScreen.tsx`
    *   **Action:** Read the `handleSubmitProfile` function. See that it calls `ProfileService.createProfile` but does not globally store the resulting profile data.
    *   **File:** `src/screens/Main/UserBaseChartScreen.tsx`
    *   **Action:** Read the `useEffect` hook (around line 232).
    *   **Verify:** Note that this screen fetches its own data using `baseChartService.getUserBaseChart`. This is a separate, uncoordinated data fetch, leading to fragmentation.

3.  **Identify Hard-Coded Content:**
    *   **File:** `src/screens/Main/UserBaseChartScreen.tsx`
    *   **Action:** Read the `return` statement of the main component (around line 220).
    *   **Verify:** You will see a large, hard-coded array of objects, where strings like `"Energy Family"` and their descriptions are manually created. This is a major source of content fragility.
    *   **File:** `src/constants/narrativeCopy.ts`
    *   **Action:** Skim this file.
    *   **Verify:** Observe the "Quest" and "Journey" language. This is the legacy narrative that will be replaced.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   You have read and understood the specific code locations mentioned in this prompt.
*   You can confirm that the problems described (missing navigation gate, fragmented data fetching, hard-coded copy) exist at the specified locations.
*   You are prepared to address these specific problems in the subsequent phases.

**Warning:** Proceeding without a clear understanding of these core issues will lead to incorrect implementation. Do not proceed until you have verified these points.

**Next Step:** Phase 2, where you will begin writing code to create the `ProfileAssemblyGate`.
